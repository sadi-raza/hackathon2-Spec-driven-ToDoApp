# Implementation Plan: Todo Application Enhancement - Intermediate Level

**Branch**: `001-todo-enhancement` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: [specs/001-todo-enhancement/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-enhancement/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extending the existing Phase I in-memory console Todo application with Intermediate Level features: priorities (High/Medium/Low), tags/categories, search, filter, and sort capabilities. The implementation will enhance the Task model with priority, tags, and creation timestamp, add new methods to the TodoManager for filtering, searching, and sorting, and update the CLI interface to support the new functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (Phase I requirement from constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Built-in Python libraries (dataclasses, datetime, re, typing), standard library only
**Storage**: In-memory only (Phase I requirement from constitution)
**Testing**: Manual testing via CLI interface
**Target Platform**: Linux server/console environment
**Project Type**: Single console application - extending existing structure
**Performance Goals**: O(n) acceptable for small lists (as specified in feature requirements)
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 response, in-memory only, console-based interface
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 1000 tasks in memory (as per success criteria SC-002)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution principles to verify:
- Zero Manual Coding: All code must be generated by Claude Code after refining specifications ✅
- Spec-Driven Development: All features must originate from /specs/ and reference Task IDs ✅
- Reusable Intelligence: At least 3 Agent Skills and 2 Subagents must be created and reused ✅
- MCP Servers: Follow MCP SDK requirements per phase (I-II: No MCP, III-V: MCP required) ✅
- Phase Evolution: Follow phase-specific constraints and requirements ✅
- Quality Standards: Clean code, type hints, proper structure per phase ✅
- Violation Hierarchy: Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks ✅

```

**Structure Decision**: Single console project extending existing Phase I structure. The implementation will update the Task model to include priority, tags, and created_at fields, enhance the TodoManager with new filtering, searching, and sorting methods, and update the CLI interface to support the new functionality while maintaining all existing features.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Extended CLI menu structure | Required to support new features while maintaining usability | Simple linear menu would not accommodate filter/sort/search sub-options |
| Enhanced data model | Required to support priorities, tags, and creation timestamps | Simple extension of existing model would not meet functional requirements |
