# Project Specification: Phase I - Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Phase Objective
Build a fully functional command-line Todo application that stores tasks in memory (no database) using 100% Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

This is Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" project. The app must demonstrate clean, professional Python code structure while strictly following the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement via Claude Code only.

## Target Users
- Developers learning Spec-Driven Development
- Hackathon judges evaluating process, prompts, and adherence to no-manual-coding rule
- Future phases will build directly on this console foundation

## Core Requirements (Basic Level Features - MUST Implement All 5)

As a user, I can:

1. **Add Task**
   - Create a new todo item with required title (string) and optional description (string)
   - Task automatically gets a unique incremental ID
   - Task created with completed = False by default

2. **View Task List**
   - Display all tasks in a clean formatted table/list
   - Show: ID, Title, Description (truncated if long), Status (✅ Completed / ⏳ Pending)
   - Show total count at the end

3. **Update Task**
   - Modify title and/or description of an existing task by ID
   - User prompted for new values (can keep existing by pressing Enter)

4. **Mark as Complete / Incomplete**
   - Toggle the completion status of a task by ID
   - Visual confirmation shown

5. **Delete Task**
   - Permanently remove a task by ID
   - Confirmation prompt before deletion

## Non-Functional Requirements

- In-memory storage only (list/dict of task objects, no files or database)
- Clean, modular Python code following best practices
- Proper type hints (use dataclasses or Pydantic models)
- Error handling for invalid ID, empty title, etc.
- User-friendly CLI prompts and messages
- Interactive loop until user types "exit" or "quit"

## Technology Constraints

- Python 3.13+
- Managed via UV (uv venv, uv pip for any dependencies)
- No external packages required (standard library only preferred)
- All code generated by Claude Code (no manual coding allowed)

## Project Structure (Must Follow)

└── CLAUDE.md                     # Root instructions for Claude Code

## Deliverables (Judges Will Check These)

1. Public GitHub repository containing:
   - speckit.constitution
   - /specs folder with versioned specification files
   - /src folder with clean Python source
   - Comprehensive README.md with:
     • Project overview
     • Setup: uv venv, uv run src/main.py
     • Demo commands
   - CLAUDE.md with clear workflow instructions

2. Working console application that demonstrates all 5 features smoothly

## Acceptance Criteria

- All 5 basic features work flawlessly
- Code is clean, readable, well-structured with separation of concerns
- No manual coding evidence (Claude Code iterations visible in commits/prompts)
- App runs with: uv run src/main.py
- User can exit gracefully
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs

## Out of Scope for Phase I
- Persistence (file/DB)
- Authentication
- Priorities, due dates, tags
- Web/API interface
- AI chatbot features

This specification is the single source of truth for Phase I. All planning, tasks, and implementation must trace back to these requirements.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Phase I Todo In-Memory Python Console App. The specification includes:

- 5 prioritized user stories covering all core requirements (Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Mark Complete/Incomplete, Delete Task)
- Detailed acceptance scenarios for each user story
- 10 functional requirements covering all necessary system behaviors
- Key entity definition for the Task object
- 5 measurable success criteria
- Constitution compliance requirements

The specification follows the template structure with mandatory sections completed and is ready for the planning phase. A quality checklist was created and all validation items passed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - Complete specification for Phase I of Todo app evolution
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests created yet (will be created in tasks phase)
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements.md checklist created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Planning phase with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification is comprehensive and ready for development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validation items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning phase with /sp.plan
