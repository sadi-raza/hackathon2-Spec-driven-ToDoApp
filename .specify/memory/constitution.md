# hackathon-todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### Zero Manual Coding Allowed
Every single line of code (Python, TypeScript, YAML, Docker, Helm, etc.) MUST be generated by Claude Code after refining specifications. Manual edits only allowed for fixing Claude-generated syntax errors (must be documented in commit message with Task ID). Judges will review Claude Code chat history, prompts, and iterations.

### Spec-Driven Development is the Single Source of Truth
All features, architecture, APIs, database schema, deployment configs MUST originate from files in /specs/. Every implementation MUST reference a Task ID from speckit.tasks which traces back to speckit.specify and speckit.plan. Use @specs/path/to/file.md referencing in all Claude prompts.

### Reusable Intelligence Mandatory
Create and actively use at least 3 Agent Skills in .claude/skills/ and at least 2 Subagents in .claude/agents/. Skills and Subagents MUST be reused across phases (e.g., task-validator skill used in Phase I, III, V). Demonstrate delegation: orchestrator subagent → task-manager subagent → MCP tools.

### MCP Servers Architecture
Phase I–II: No MCP needed. Phase III–V: Official MCP SDK MUST be used to expose stateless task tools. Primary MCP Server: FastAPI backend itself (exposes add_task, list_tasks, update_task, delete_task, complete_task). Bonus MCP Server: Spec-Kit Plus commands exposed via MCP (specifyplus init, plan, tasks as tools). All agents MUST interact with application state ONLY via MCP tools (never direct DB calls).

### Phase-Wise Evolution Constraints
Phase I: Pure Python console, in-memory, UV + Python 3.13+. Phase II: Monorepo, Next.js 16 (App Router) + FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon Serverless Postgres + Better Auth with JWT. Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit frontend + OpenAI Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK + Stateless chat endpoint + Conversation persistence in DB. Phase IV: Docker (use Gordon where possible) + Minikube + Helm Charts + kubectl-ai + kagent for AIOps. Phase V: DigitalOcean DOKS + Kafka (Redpanda preferred) + Full Dapr (Pub/Sub, State, Jobs API, Secrets, Service Invocation) + Event-driven architecture for reminders, recurring tasks, real-time sync.

### Reusable Intelligence Specific Requirements
Agent Skills MUST include: todo-task-validator (title/description/priority/due_date rules), natural-language-parser (English + Urdu support for bonus), mcp-tool-caller (confirmation + error handling pattern). Subagents MUST include: task-manager (handles all CRUD via MCP tools, uses validator skill), chatbot-orchestrator (parses input, delegates to task-manager, handles Urdu), deployment-expert (Phase IV/V – generates Helm, Dapr components). Orchestrator MUST delegate to subagents, never perform tasks directly.

## Bonus Features Targeted
Multi-language Support: Urdu detection and response in chatbot (+100). Voice Commands via Web Speech API (+200 possible). Cloud-Native Blueprints via Agent Skills (+200 possible).

## Quality & Style Standards
Clean code, type hints, proper project structure per phase. All API endpoints follow documented paths and JWT auth. Stateless where required, persistent state only in Neon DB. Comprehensive README.md + CLAUDE.md hierarchy. Demo videos under 90 seconds showing spec → implementation flow.

## Violation Hierarchy
Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks. Any conflict: Constitution wins. Any agent (Claude, subagent) violating these rules MUST stop and request human clarification.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development from Phase I through Phase V. All agents, skills, and subagents MUST adhere strictly. Any changes to this constitution require explicit approval and must be documented with a clear rationale. Compliance with these principles is mandatory and will be verified during judging.
