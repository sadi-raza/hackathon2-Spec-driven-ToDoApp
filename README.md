#Hackathon II#
The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI
The future of software development is AI-native and spec-driven. As AI agents like Claude Code become more powerful, the role of the engineer shifts from "syntax writer" to "system architect." We have already explored Spec-Driven Book Authoring. Now, we want you to master the Architecture of Intelligence.
In this hackathon, you will master the art of building applications iteratively—starting from a simple console app and evolving it into a fully-featured, cloud-native AI chatbot deployed on Kubernetes. This journey will teach you the Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development, Claude Code, Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence and Cloud-Native AI technologies through hands-on implementation.
